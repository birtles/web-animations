      ReSpec.js wishlist:

      Add here any issues you find with ReSpec including missing features. It
      will help us decide if we should continue using it and work out what we
      need to fix.

      * Need ability to cross-reference members of interfaces (e.g. constants
        etc.)
      * Get rid of the description section next to parameters? It seems more
        natural to describe the parameters in the description of the method?
      * Allow making cross-references to specific methods and members.
      * Don't make unofficial drafts use the Creative Commons Attribution
        license.
      * Support enums in WebIDL
      * Support NamedConstructors (including where the parameters use angle
        brackets like sequence<TimedTemplate>)

      This is the abstract for your specification.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines features for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform by means of a programming interface.
        This interface is intended to be used both directly to easily produce
        animations using script, as well as a foundation for other
        specifications whose behavior can be defined in terms of these features.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG112]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a web page.
          Although the three specifications provide similar functionality,
          the syntaxes are incompatible and the animations cannot be
          interchanged.
          Furthermore, the interfaces available for interacting with animations
          from script are largely general-purpose interfaces with few features
          tuned specifically to the creation and manipulation of animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification proposes an abstract animations model that
          encompasses the abilities of both CSS and SVG, and additionally
          provides a programming interface to expose these features to script.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification is accompanied by a CSS embedding specification,
          which describes how CSS features can be implemented in terms of Web 
          Animations primitives, and an SVG embedding specification, which
          describes how SVG features can be implemented in terms of Web
          Animations primitives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, this specification does not directly alter the behavior
          of CSS Transitions, CSS Animations, or SVG.
          However, Web Animations is intended to replace the SMIL Animation
          [[SMIL-ANIMATION]] specification where it is currently used to define
          the behavior of SVG's animation features.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification makes some additions to some interfaces defined in
          HTML5 [[HTML5]].

      <h2>Web Animations overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, Web Animations consists of two largely independent
        pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation model</em>.
        The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> produced by the timing model and
          converts them into a series of values to apply to the target
          properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of Web Animations.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a time
        fraction.<br>
        This distance is used as input to the animation model which produces the
        values to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100 pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width for
        the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to the
        animation model.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>The animation timeline</h2>
      <p>
        Each document contains a timeline to which animations may be added.
        These animations have an interval during which they are scheduled to
        animate.
      </p>
      <p class="caption">
        At time <em>t</em> animations A and B are animating.
        Animation C has finished animating.
        Animation D has yet to begin and is not animating.
      </p>
      <p>
        The start time of the timeline is defined in <a
        href="#start-of-the-timeline" class="sectionRef"></a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Animations in the timeline</h2>
      <p>
        Animations in the timeline are represented by
        <code>AnimInstance</code> objects.
