      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Web Animations defines features for supporting animation and
        synchronization on the Web platform by means of a programming interface.
        This interface is intended to be used both directly to easily produce
        animations using script, as well as a foundation for other
        specifications whose behavior can be defined in terms of these features.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Relationship to other specifications</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations 
          [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and SVG [[SVG112]] all provide mechanisms that
          generate animated content on a web page.
          Although the three specifications provide similar functionality,
          the syntaxes are incompatible and the animations cannot be
          interchanged.
          Furthermore, the interfaces available for interacting with animations
          from script are largely general-purpose interfaces with few features
          tuned specifically to the creation and manipulation of animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification proposes an abstract animations model that
          encompasses the abilities of both CSS and SVG, and additionally
          provides a programming interface to expose these features to script.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification is accompanied by a CSS embedding specification,
          which describes how CSS features can be implemented in terms of Web 
          Animations primitives, and an SVG embedding specification, which
          describes how SVG features can be implemented in terms of Web
          Animations primitives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, this specification does not directly alter the behavior
          of CSS Transitions, CSS Animations, or SVG.
          However, Web Animations is intended to replace the SMIL Animation
          [[SMIL-ANIMATION]] specification where it is currently used to define
          the behavior of SVG's animation features.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specifications makes some additions to some interfaces defined in
          HTML5 [[HTML5]].

      <h2>Web Animations overview</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, Web Animations can be considered in two largely independent
        pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation model</em>.
        The role of these pieces is as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timing model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
          within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>time
          fraction</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Animation model</dt>
        <dd>
          Takes the <em>time fractions</em> produced by the timing model and
          converts them into a series of values to apply to the target
          properties and attributes.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="figure">
        <object data="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="700"></object>
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Overview of the operation of Web Animations.<br>
        The current time is input to the timing model which produces a distance
        within an iteration.<br>
        This distance is used as input to the animation model which produces the
        values to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider an animation that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>starts after 3 seconds,</li>
        <li>runs twice,</li>
        <li>takes 2 seconds every time, and</li>
        <li>changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100 pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first three points apply to the timing model.
        At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
        half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
        The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width for
        the rectangle of 75.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to the
        animation model.

      <h2>The animation timeline</h2>
      <p>
        Each document contains a timeline to which animations may be added.
        Each animation has an interval during which it is scheduled to animate.

      <p>
        <code>AnimInstance</code> objects are not created directly, but
        via a separate <code>Anim</code> object. The
        <code>Anim</code> object acts a template allowing the same set
        of animation parameters to be used multiple times with multiple target
        elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <code>AnimInstance</code> can be in one of two states with
        regards to the relationship between it and the <code>Anim</code>
        that produced it.

        <dd>

      </dl>
      <p class="todo">
        Add a diagram which shows a live animation instance and an independent
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Live animation instances can be converted to independent animation
        instances by one of two means:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Modifying any of the members of the <code>function</code> or
          <code>timing</code> properties of the
          <code>AnimInstance</code> object. This includes redundant
          modifications, that is, setting a property to its current value.
          <!--
           The redundant modification condition is an attempt to eliminate an
           area where interop might fail subtley.

           If, internally, implementation A filters out redundant changes whilst
           implementation B blindly accepts all changes we still want the same
           behaviour with regards to becoming independent. It's easier, more
           convenient and, I think, more intuitive for authors to define it this
           way.

           The alternative, requiring redundant changes to be ignored, is more
           complex as we need to specify what consitutes a redundant change and
           that's not always easy as the data types become complex. For example,
           what constitutues a redundant change to an SVGLength is not always
           obvious.
           -->
        </li>
        <li>
          Calling the <code>makeIndependent</code> method of the
          <code>AnimInstance</code> object.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Once independent, animation instances cannot be made live again.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        One implication of the fact that a live instance can be converted to an
        independent instance is that when a live instance is created, the object
        identity of its <code>function</code> and <code>timing</code> properties
        must differ from those of the animation from which it was created. This
        is because, for example, modifying the <code>timing.duration</code>
        property of a live animation instance and hence converting it to an
        independent animation instance, cannot at the same time change the
        object identity of the <code>timing</code> property.
      </p>
      <pre class="example sh_javascript">
        // Create a new animation
        var anim = new Anim();
        anim.timing.duration = 1;

        // Create a live instance
        var instance = anim.animateLive(document.getElementById('a'));
        alert(instance.timing.iterationDuration); // Displays "1"

        // Modify the animation
        anim.timing.duration = 2;
        alert(instance.timing.iterationDuration); // Displays "2"

        // Modify both the animation and instance
        instance.timing.iterationDuration = 3;    // instance is now independent
        anim.timing.iterationDuration = 4;
        alert(instance.timing.iterationDuration); // Displays "3"
      </pre>

      <section>
        <h3>The <code>TimedTemplate</code> interface</h3>
        <p>
          Both the timing of an <code>Anim</code> and the methods for
          creating an <code>AnimInstance</code> from
          an <code>Anim</code> are specified on the
          <code>TimedTemplate</code> since this behaviour is shared with
          animation groups
          (see <a href="#grouping-and-synchronization" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <dl title="interface TimedTemplate" class="idl">
          <dt>attribute Timing timing</dt>
          <dd>
            The timing parameters to use for generated timed items.
          </dd>
          <dt>TimedItem animate ()</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Creates an independent <code>TimedItem</code> and appends it
              to <code>element.ownerDocument.animationTimeline</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This allows the following sort of usage:
            </p>
            <pre class="example sh_javascript">
              anim.animate(document.getElementById("a"));
            </pre>
            <p>
              The specific steps for instantiating a
              <code>TimedTemplate</code> depends on its concrete type and is
              described in <a href="#instantiating-an-anim"
              class="sectionRef"></a> and <a
              href="#instantiating-an-animgroup"
              class="sectionRef"></a>.
            </p>
            <dl class="parameters">
              <dt>Element target</dt>
              <dd>
                The <code>Element</code> to be targetted.
              </dd>
              <dt>optional float startTime</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  The start time for the generated animation instances
                  expressed in seconds in the iteration time space of the
                  <code>AnimGroupInstance</code> to which it is
                  appended (see <a href="#iteration-time-and-animation-time"
                    class="sectionRef"></a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  If this parameter is not specified it will default to the
                  current iteration time of the
                  <code>AnimGroupInstance</code> to which it is
                  appended if it is not <code>null</code>, otherwise it will
                  default to zero.
                </p>

              As with <code>animate(Element target, float startTime)</code>
              each such <code>TimedItem</code> object is appended
              to <code>element.ownerDocument.animationTimeline</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This allows the following sort of usage:

        <h3>Animation states</h3>
        <p>
          An individual animation instance can be in one of three possible
          states:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Animating (active)</dt>
          <dd>
            The animation instance is executing, and will apply its effect to
            its target.
          </dd>
          <dt>Filling (active)</dt>
          <dd>
            The animation instance has yet to start executing or has already
            finished but is still effecting its target due to the fill mode
            specified (see <a href="#animation-fill-behavior"
              class="sectionRef"></a>).
          </dd>
          <dt>Inactive</dt>
          <dd>
            The animation instance has yet to start executing or has already
            finished and is not effecting its target. Animations that do not
            belong to a group and consequently have no notion of time are also
            considered inactive (see <a href="#grouping-and-synchronization"
            class="sectionRef"></a>).
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          An animation instance is considered <em>active</em> if it is in either
          the <em>animating</em> or <em>filling</em> state.
        </p>
        <p>
          An animation may not enter all of these states depending on when it
          starts, its duration, and the fill behavior defined (see <a
          href="#animation-fill-behavior" class="sectionRef"></a>). An example
          sequence of states is illustrated below.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

          An example of the animation states for an animation with a forwards

          delay or positive start time (see <a href="#the-animation-interval"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).<br>
          Then the animation begins executing and enters the animating
          state.<br>
          When the animation has completed, a forwards fill is applied and the
          animation enters the filling state.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>The animation interval</h3>
          <p>
            The period that an animation instance is animating is called the
            <em>animation interval</em>.
            Each animation instance has only one such interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            The start of the interval is determined by the <var>start
            time</var> of the animation instance but may be shifted by
            a <var>start delay</var> on the animation instance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The end of the interval is determined by the <var>animation
            duration</var> (see <a href="#calculating-the-animation-duration"
            class="sectionRef"></a>).

        <h3>Animation fill behavior</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of the animation interval, an animation instance may still
          effect its target depending on its fill mode. The different modes are
          as follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>none</dt>
          <dd>
            The animation instance does not effect its target outside the active
            interval.
          </dd>
          <dt>forwards</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur later than the animation interval, the
            animation instance will continue to apply to its target the
            animation value that was used at the end of the animation interval.

            For times that occur before the animation interval, the animation
            instance will not effect its target.
          </dd>
          <dt>backwards</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur before the animation interval, the animation
            instance will apply the same animation value that will be used at
            the start of the animation interval.

            For times that occur later than the animation interval, the
            animation instance will not effect its target.
          </dd>
          <dt>both</dt>
          <dd>
            For times that occur before the animation interval, the backwards
            fill behavior is used.

            For times that occur after the animation interval, the forwards fill
            behavior is used.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Some examples of the these fill modes and the corresponding animation
          states are illustrated below.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">

        <h3>Iteration time and animation time</h3>
        <p>
          Times in Web Animations are relative to some point of reference. These
          different points of reference produce different time spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
          graphics.
          The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
          a coordinate space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within Web Animations, some of the common time spaces are:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Document time space</dt>
          <dd>
            A time space whose zero time is the start time of the document
            timeline as defined in <a href="#start-of-the-timeline"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.
          </dd>
          <dt>Item time space</dt>
          <dd>
            A time space whose zero time is the timed item's (e.g. an animation
            instance) start time.
          </dd>
          <dt>Animation time space</dt>
          <dd>
            A time space whose zero time is the beginning of a timed item's
            animation interval.
          </dd>
          <dt>Iteration time space</dt>
          <dd>
            A time space whose zero time is the beginning of the current
            iteration.
            When the animation instance is inactive it is set to the iteration
            time that will produce the appropriate fill value regardless of the
            setting of the fill mode.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          In addition to these time spaces, when animation groups are used (see
          <a href="#grouping-and-synchronization" class="sectionRef"></a>) we
          can talk about the <em>parent iteration time space</em>. The zero time
          of <em>parent iteration time space</em> is the beginning of the parent
          animation group's current iteration. When animation groups are not
          used, this is equivalent to <em>document time space</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these time spaces are illustrated below.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <object data="img/time-spaces.svg" width="600"></object>
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          A comparison of item time, animation time, and iteration time for an
          animation with a iteration duration of 1s and an iteration count of
          2.5.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that while the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web
          Animations defines <var>animation time</var> and <var>iteration
          time</var> such that they are clamped to a set range as shown in the
          diagram.
          For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
          <em>animation time space</em>, querying the <var>animation time</var>
          of an animation instance will never return a negative value due to the
          clamping performed when this value is calculated (see <a
          href="#calculating-the-animation-time" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>Iteration duration and animation duration</h4>
          <p>
            These time spaces can also be used to describe intervals and
            durations. The distinction between iteration duration and active
            duration is particularly common. The definition of these terms falls
            out of the definition of the time spaces and is summarized as
            follows:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Iteration duration</dt>
            <dd>
              The time taken for a single iteration of the item to complete.
            </dd>
            <dt>Animation duration</dt>
            <dd>
              The time taken for the animation phase of the item to complete.
              This may be longer or shorter than the iteration duration.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            This may be visualized as follows:

          <h4>Interval timing</h4>
          <p>
            For intervals of time, Web Animations uses an endpoint-exclusive
            timing model. This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
            is included in the interval, the end time time is not. In interval
            notation this can written <code>[begin,end)</code>. This model
            provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and sequenced
            since there is no overlap between intervals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the examples below, for the repeated animation, at animation time
            1s, the iteration time is 0.
            For the sequenced animation, at parent iteration time 1s, animation
            A has become inactive, and animation B is now active; there is no
            overlap.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <object data="img/endpoint-exclusive-timing.svg"
                width="600"></object>
          </div>
          <p class="caption">
            Illustration of end-point exclusive timing. For both repeated and
            sequenced animations there is no overlap at the boundaries between
            intervals.
          </p>
          <p>
            An exception to this behavior is that when performing a fill, if
            the fill begins at an interval endpoint, the endpoint is used. This
            behavior falls out of the algorithm given in <a
            href="#calculating-the-unscaled-iteration-time"
            class="sectionRef"></a> and is demonstrated below.

        <h3>Pausing a timed item</h3>
        <p>
          Timed items may be paused and resumed independently of the parent
          animation group instance they belong to.
          The effect is that the time of the item drifts from that of its
          parent.
          This drift is called the <var>start offset</var> since it acts as an
          additional delay added to the <var>start time</var> of the item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Timed elements that do not have a parent animation group may still be
          paused and resumed.
          However, except for the case of the document timeline, there will be
          no observable effect until the element is attached to a parent
          animation group instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <var>start offset</var> produced by pausing can be calculated as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Let <var>start offset</var> be initially zero.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the pause state is newly true, record the <var>parent iteration
            time</var> as <var>pause start time</var>.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the next sample, increment <var>start offset</var> by
            <code><var>parent iteration time</var> - <var>pause start
            time</var></code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Update <var>pause start time</var> to <var>parent iteration
            time</var>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each sample while paused and when the pause
            state is newly false.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          An important characteristic of the above procedure is that the
          <var>start offset</var> continues to accumulate while the
          item is paused. As a result, the <var>start offset</var> must be

        <h3>Seeking a timed item</h3>
        <p>
          Seeking, like pausing, has the effect of causing a timed item's
          time to drift from that of its parent animation group instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a seek operation is performed, the <var>start offset</var> is set
          according to the following formula:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <code><var>start offset</var> = <var>parent iteration time</var>
            - <var>start time</var> - <var>seek time</var></code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <var>parent iteration time</var> - is the iteration time of the
            parent animation group instance if there is one, otherwise it is
            zero.
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>start time</var> - is the start time of the item being
            seeked.
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>seek time</var> - is the time to seek to expressed in the
            item time space.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The animation events dispatched when a seek is performed are described
          in <a href="#animation-events" class="sectionRef"></a>.
        </p>
        <p class="informative">
          Note that seeking a timed item does not reset the state of the timed
          item or its children.
          For example, if an application is configured to produce new animations
          in response to animation end events, seeking the document timeline
          backwards will not remove the created animations. As a result, a naive
          application may create overlapping animations on subsequent replays.
          It is the application's responsibility to restore the original state
          of the document in such situations.

        <p class="feedbackWanted">
          Is it worth adding "seek" events for this? Or the ability to mark
          animations as "remove-on-seek" (or something of that ilk).
        </p>
        <p class="feedbackWanted">
          I wonder if it makes sense to clear accumulated start offsets in some
          states. If you rewind a document to the start, then it's perhaps
          counter-intuitive if, on replay, the accumulated start offset due to
          pauses still takes effect. Or maybe it's ok? Bear in mind, that if we
          do add some feature here, it should ideally work the same when the
          document is played in reverse.

      <p>
        While it is possible to set the timing properties of animations and
        their instances individually, it is often useful to bundle animations
        together and control their timing as a group.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be used to share common timing properties as illustrated below:

        (a) Shows setting a delay of 5 seconds on individual animations.<br>
        (b) Produces the same effect by setting the delay on the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as sharing timing information, by grouping animations together
        they can be seeked, paused, and stopped as a unit.

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Relationship of group time to child time</h3>
        <p>
          The timing of the children of a group is based on the timing of the
          group. Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
          <em>iteration time</em>. That is, the children animate <em>inside</em>
          an iteration of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, consider repetition. If a group has an iteration count
          of 3, then the children of of the group will all play three times
          since they effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
          <object data="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600"></object>
        </div>
        <p class="caption">
          Since children of an animation group base their timing on the group's
          <var>iteration time</var>, when the group repeats, the children play
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an iteration count is specified for the children of a group as well
          as for the group the effect is as if the iteration count of the group
          was multiplied with the iteration count of the children.

          Specifying an iteration count of 2 on an animation group and an

          A further result of the children of a group basing their timing on the
          group's <var>iteration time</var> is that they cannot animate outside
          of the group's active interval. This is because the <var>iteration
          time</var> of a group will not change outside its active interval.
          This allows groups to clip the playback of their children.

        <h3>Types of groups</h3>
        <p>
          Groups can be used to provide synchronization behavior for its
          children.
          For example, one type of group runs its children in parallel, whilst
          another type runs the children in sequence.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Groups can also contain other groups which allows for more
          sophisticated synchronization.

        <h3>The document timeline</h3>
        <p>
          We have previously referred to the document timeline as the context in
          which animation takes places. Likewise we have referred to the
          <em>document time space</em> as the master time space which contains
          other time spaces. The document timeline is, in fact, a parallel
          animation group instance with the following special properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It cannot be appended as a child of another group. As a result the
            <code>parentGroup</code> property returns <code>null</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attempting to set the <code>type</code> property will result in a
            DOMException (code: NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR) being thrown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calls to <code>cancel()</code> will result in a DOMException (code:
            HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR) being thrown.

          <li>
            For properties that represent times in <em>parent iteration time
            space</em> a time space whose zero time is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January
            1970 is used instead.
            For example, the <code>startTime</code> property of the document
            timeline represents the number of seconds between 00:00:00 UTC on
            1 January 1970 and when the timeline started (see <a

        <h3>Groups and liveness</h3>
        <p>
          As with animations, animation groups act as templates that can be
          instantiated (see <a href="#creating-animations"
          class="sectionRef"></a>).
          The resulting groups can likewise be <em>live</em> or
          <em>independent</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Live animation group instances can be made independent by the
          following means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Modifying any of the members of the <code>timing</code> property or
            modifying the <code>type</code> property of the
            <code>AnimGroupInstance</code> object.
            This includes redundant modifications, that is, setting a property
            to its current value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calling any of the methods that affect the list of child items
            (<code>clear</code>, <code>append</code>, <code>insertBefore</code>,
            or <code>remove</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Calling the <code>makeIndependent</code> method of the
            <code>AnimGroupInstance</code> object.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that making an animation group instance independent does
          <em>NOT</em> cause its child <code>TimedTemplate</code> objects
          to become independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, making a child of an animation group instance independent
          does <em>NOT</em> cause the animation group instance itself
          to become independent.
        </p>

        <h3>The <code>AnimGroupInstance</code> interface</h3>
        <p>
          Represents a list of timed items which may be animation instances or
          nested animation group instances. Order is significant only when
          <code>type</code> is <code>WEBA_SYNC_SEQ</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="feedbackWanted">
          <p>
            For adding and removing items this interface relies on passing in
            actual <a>TimedItem</a> objects. This is similar to the Element
            interface but differs from many SVG interfaces which use numeric
            indices instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using objects instead of indices is generally more useful since,
            even if you only know the index you can easily convert it to an
            object (e.g. <code>remove(group.getItem(2))</code>) but the reverse
            conversion is more difficult. However, there are performance costs
            associated with creating these objects in situations where indices
            are sufficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the interface defined below, it's really hard to (a) remove and
            re-add an item in the same place, (b) move an item forward one
            place. DOM doesn't have this problem because it has
            <code>nextSibling</code> and co. The SVG interfaces also don't have
            this problem because they use indexes but they <em>do</em> have
            the problem that working with a passed in object is very difficult
            (because you don't know its index). Maybe we need nextSibling? Or
            something to take an item and find its index?
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the use of exceptions below is perhaps a little inconsistent.
            I've used exceptions for cases which are exceptional. For
            <code>item</code> I think it's reasonable to return null (like
            <code>NodeList</code>). Likewise, for <code>remove</code> I think
            it's useful to just return <code>null</code> rather than throwing
            an exception (e.g. if it has already been removed / not yet added).
            Maybe you really want to return null if it has no parent and throw
            an exception if it belongs to another group?

                Note that a consequence of the above is that, for example, if
                you change a container from type <code>par</code> to
                <code>seq</code> you could potentially generate a lot of end
                events followed by a lot of begin events despite the fact that
                the animation might not produce any different visual result. We
                could change the behavior so that it effectively records the
                play state of each item before and then after the "seek"
                dispatches the appropriate events.

          <p>
            It seems like it might even be
            useful to allow script to provide its own function. I'm not sure how
            that works exactly, but if we were to support that, then the
            interface would be something like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>Sample(float iterationProgress, Element target, any
              underlyingValue)</code> (where <code>iterationProgress</code> is
              the ratio of <var>iteration time</var> to <var>iteration
              duration</var>)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Implementations of the function would be expected to produce the
            same result given the same parameters so the implementation could
            cache the result and not call the function when the parameters were
            the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            That would potentially let you animate anything. Anything! (And,
            that could be bad. The callback could rewrite the entire document
            every sample. After returning from the callback you'd have to do
            a lot of checks regarding the state of the world before continuing.)

          readonly when this object is returned from
          an <code>AnimInstance</code> object. Objects returned from
          an <code>Anim</code>, however, are live.

              What happens if you change it? The array returned by the

              be nice if the result was deterministic rather than just left up

      <h2>Combining animations</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>The Global Animation Stack</h3>
        <p>
          When multiple active animations target the same element, the
          animations are ordered into a stack which resolves how those 
          animations combine. This stack is sorted by animation start time.
          Where multiple animations have the same start time, those animations
          are sorted in document order (for animations from the DOM) and script
          order (for animations from the API). Script animations are always
          sorted after DOM animations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other operations also generate animation stacks - for example, 
          grouping multiple animations using a 
          <code>GroupedAnimFunction</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An animation stack may be thought of as a single stack with all
          animations sorted into it, or a stack per animating element, as
          animations on one element cannot effect the course of animations on 
          another element.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The start time of an animation refers to the recorded or 
          calculated start time (i.e. the point where an animation changes 
          phase from <code>Inactive</code> to <code>Delayed</code>), not the
          point at which the animation actually starts (i.e. the point where
          an animation changes phase from <code>Delayed</code> to 
          <code>Animating</code>). 
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The stacking order of animations is independent of the
          current play direction of individual animations and animation
          groups.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Resolving Animation Stacks</h3>
        <p>
          In order to resolve an animation stack, an initial animation
          value is required for each element and property animated by the
          stack.
          To calculate a current animation value for elements and properties
          from an animation stack, an animation value is generated for each
          animation in the stack 
          (see <a href="#calculating-animation-values" class="sectionRef"></a>).
          The cumulative animation result for each element and property is first
          initialised to the relevant initial animation value.
          Starting at the bottom of the stack (i.e. earliest start time) and
          working up, as animation results are encountered for an element
          and property, these are merged into the cumulative animation result
          using the animation combinator stored in the 
          <code>AnimFunction</code> that generated the result.
          Once all animation results in the stack are processed, the resulting
          cumulative animation values are the current animation values for
          each property of each element that is animated.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Animation combinators</h3>
        <p>
          When an animation applies to a target and property that animations
          earlier in the animation stack have already applied to, the
          cumulative animation result from the stack is composited with the new
          animation to produce a new cumulative animation result.
          The possible combinators are defined as <code>WEBA_OPERATION_*</code>
          constants in the <code>AnimFunction</code> interface.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h4>The REPLACE combinator</h4>
          <p>
            When an animation <code>a</code> is composited over a cumulative
            animation result <code>c</code> using the REPLACE combinator, the
            new cumulative animation result is always <code>a</code>.

          <h4>The ACCUMULATE combinator</h4>

            cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the ACCUMULATE
            combinator, the effective transform of <code>a</code> is calculated.
            This transform is then post-multiplied to the cumulative animation
            result to generate a new cumulative animation result.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a transform animation <code>a</code> is composited over a
            cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the ACCUMULATE
            combinator, <code>a</code> is post-multiplied to the cumulative
            animation result to generate a new cumulative animation result.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a simple animation (i.e. an animation which is not a path
            animation nor a transform animation) <code>a</code> is composited
            over a cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the
            ACCUMULATE combinator, the new cumulative animation result is the
            sum of <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>, clipped if necessary to
            the appropriate domain.

        <section>
          <h4>The MERGE combinator</h4>
          <p>
            All MERGE operators are governed by an interpolation parameter
            <code>p</code> that is calculated as the ratio of
            <code>(currentTime - parent.startTime) / parent.animationDuration</code>,
            where <code>parent</code> is the <code>Anim</code> which
            references the <code>AnimFunction</code> that is being
            composited.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a path animation <code>a</code> is composited over a
            cumulative animation result <code>c</code> using the MERGE
            combinator, the effective transform of <code>a</code> is
            calculated.
            This transform is then interpolated with <code>c</code> using the
            rules provided in [[!CSS3-2D-TRANSFORMS]] to provide the new
            cumulative animation result.
          </p>

            When a transform animation <code>a</code> is composited over a

            When a simple animation <code>a</code> is composited over a

            the weighted sum of <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>, with weights
            of <code>(1-p)</code> and <code>p</code> respectively.

        <h3>Computing the override stylesheet</h3>
        <p>
          The override stylesheet contains output animation values and
          acts with a higher priority than all other stylesheets. However,
          !important rules from all other stylesheets act with a higher priority
          than the override stylesheet.
          The override stylesheet is regenerated for each timepoint in a
          document using the following process:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A global animation stack is generated as described in

          </li>
          <li>
            An initial animation value is generated by taking the current
            style for each object (ignoring the override stylesheet) and
            extracting a value for each animated property.
          </li>
          <li>
            The global animation stack is resolved using the initial animation
            value and the process in

      <h2>Synchronizing with media</h2>
      <div class="feedbackWanted">
        <p>
          We want to model synchronizing with media as forcing the pause/play 
          and current time state of content to be synchronized to match the 
          state of the media. There are two basic possibilities here:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Create a container type that causes all contained items to have
              synchronized pause/play and current time state. The pause state
              of such containers would be the union of pause states of children,
              and calls to set the current time of any child would be diverted
              to modify the current time of the parent instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this could be a completely new container type 
              (e.g. a "synchronized" or "media" container) or an optional
              parameter modifying existing container types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add an option to the children that, when set, causes them to be
              synchronized to the parent state. The pause state of the parent 
              would need to take the pause state of synchronized children into 
              account. Calls to set the current time of synchronized children 
              would be diverted to modify the current time of the parent
              instead.
            </p>
              <p>
                If this model is adopted, media can be synchronized to the 
                parent state, causing network-derived delays to propagate to the
                parent container and hence all children of that container;
                however other children of the container could still be
                independently played/paused/seeked.

      <h2>Animation events</h2>
      <p>
        Need to consider how to align with existing
        <code>TransitionEvent</code>s, <code>AnimationEvent</code>s and
        <code>TimeEvent</code>s. It might make sense to have our events inherit
        from one or more of these interfaces or have implementations dispatch
        both (especially if their synchronization properties differ).
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we might also want a seek event? It seems like a lot of
        applications will want to do bookkeeping when there's
        a seek&mdash;especially a backwards seek. It might also be necessary for
        the SVG bindings so you can clear certain events on a backwards seek as
        required by SMIL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talk about what events are dispatched on a seek.
      </p>

        <h3>Synchronizing event handlers</h3>
        <div class="todo">
          <p>
            The proposal to-date is as follows.
            Requirements for dispatch of animation events:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Animations triggered by an event handler appear to have started at
              the time the event was scheduled to be triggered.
            </li>
            <li>
              No effect of an animation for any time 't' can be reflected in
              style, DOM or animation object until any animation event handlers
              associated with dispatch times at or before 't' have returned from
              execution.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>In effect this is roughly the same as saying:</p>
          <blockquote>
            When event handlers due to  animation events run, the state of the
            world (DOM properties etc.) so  far as it is influenced by
            animation, is as if the current time was the time when the event was
            scheduled to be triggered.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            There may be many ways to realise this, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              dispatching animation events synchronously
            </li>
            <li>
              careful updating of the animation time (after waiting for
              corresponding animation events to return)
            </li>
            <li>
              pausing the world
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Shane and Tab feel that this approach is not very webby, and might
            be going to too much effort in order to support a programming
            model that should be discouraged.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the current model, the animation timeline is essentially
            static unless modified by script, which means that interrogating
            this timeline for information should be safe even in the absence
            of enforced synchronization.
            So if correct handling of an event requires precise knowledge
            about which animations have started or finished, then the timeline
            can be inspected at the time given in the event. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, triggering animations off complex functions involving
            current animation state is probably not the right way to go - 
            instead some kind of model of the state should be used and the
            animations derived from that.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, in the absence of strong use cases for synchronous events
            we feel we should go with a simpler model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some alternative approaches are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Standard asynchronous events with no guarantees about the
              state of the world when event handlers are called.
            </li>
            <li>
              Event logs like those proposed to replace DOM events.

      <h2>Extensions to Document interfaces</h2>
      <p>
        Since the document acts as a root animation group user agents MUST add
        an <code>animationTimeline</code> member to the document interface for
        each document type where animation is supported.
        For example, HTMLDocument and SVGDocument.
      </p>
      <p>
        The definition of this member is given below.
      </p>
      <dl title="partial interface HTMLDocument" class="idl">
        <dt>readonly attribute AnimGroupInstance animationTimeline</dt>
        <dd>
          The animation group instance corresponding to the root of the
          document.
          This group instance exhibits the special behavior described for the

      <h2>Animation of common data types</h2>
      <p>
        Need to describe how to interpolate/add both:
        <ol>
          <li>Integers, floats, strings etc.</li>
          <li>CSS and SVG types (colors etc.)</li>
          <ul><li>Support for HSL (if the colors are specified in HSL we should
            interpolate in that notation; but it should also be possible to
            do so regardless of how the colors are specified)</li></ul>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        For transforms I think it's defined elsewhere so we can either just
        point to that spec, or just refer to the fact that other specs should
        define how their types should be supported (or not) for animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Need to provide facility for smooth interpolation of arbitrary paths.

      <h2>Implementation requirements</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Discarding past animations</h3>
        <p>
          If implementations are required to preserve all state associated with
          animations then the resources required by an animation could continue
          to increase without limit over time. For long-running animations, and
          particularly those where animations are added dynamically, this could
          lead to degraded performance and eventual failure.
        </p>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            I'm not sure how to define this. We could say all animations with
            <code><var>end time converted to document time</var> &lt;
            <var>current document time</var> - 5min</code> can be discarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's fine, but what about crazy documents that put 1 million
            animations in a 5min span? Just leave that up to the browser.
            Also, what about mobile clients, is 5 min too long? Is this too
            prescriptive?
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe, just make some suggestions (e.g. 1 min for mobile clients,
            5 min for desktop?) and then define an exception to throw if there
            is a seek to some time outside that window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, note that defining this in terms of past intervals is
            direction-specific but that's probably ok since most long-running
            animations will run forwards.
